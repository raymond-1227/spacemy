# spacemyrebooted CSS

## About
This is an example CSS code for the retropective MySpace recreation "spacemy" profile page.

## Examples
For live example: (You can't anymore, spacemy is discontinued.)

 - Main Profile: [raymond](https://www.spacemy.xyz/profile.php?id=258) (Updated Profile ID from "82" to "258")
 
 - Satan Edition: [666](https://www.spacemy.xyz/profile.php?id=195)

## Tutorial
1. Go to your profile page.
2. Right click and inspect the elements (for example, if you want to change the background color, right click the light gray area around the container and inspect element to copy its class ID or copy the entire bracket)
3. Visit the Manage User page
4. Edit your bot CSS in the CSS section (the custom CSS form is at the Manage User page)
5. Set and you're done!

## Note (As of February 2, 2021)
Project spacemy has been discontinued, so you probably won't be able to see the CSS contents anymore, you just won't.

Well I do provide you a solution, go download the MySpace recreation project [the-real-sumsome/spacemy.xyz-rebooted](https://github.com/the-real-sumsome/spacemy.xyz-rebooted) and create your own profile to load my CSS. I wouldn't update any sort of bugs anymore from now on.
