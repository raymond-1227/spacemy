# spacemyrebooted CSS
This is an example CSS code for the bot page. (btw i got the owner false banned 937 R3KT so yeah the admin decided to delete my account on spacemy, but anyways i got my friend hosting the profile, so basically he does things to whatever i want but not like roast everyone, i need a place to css ok? **well tl;dr i basically made my friend own my account but i control the content, he manages the account**)

For live example:

 - Main Profile: [raymond](https://www.spacemy.xyz/profile.php?id=258) (Updated Profile ID from "82" to "258")
 
 - Scary Edition: [666](https://www.spacemy.xyz/profile.php?id=195)

## Tutorial

1. Go to your profile page.
2. Right click and inspect the elements (for example, if you want to change the background color, right click the light gray area around the container and inspect element to copy its class ID or copy the entire bracket)
3. Visit the Manage User page
4. Edit your bot CSS in the CSS section (the custom CSS form is at the Manage User page)
5. Set and you're done!
